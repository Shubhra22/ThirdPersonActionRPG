# Background
A story of a worrior who lost everything she had and now on a journey to get her revenge.

# Goal of the project
The goal for me is to understand the core algorithms and design pattern needed to create a big project like a Third Person Action RPG from scratch. In this project I will implement a complex character controller including Procedural Animations, weapon effects, AI and much more. I will try to follow standard coding practices like proper design pattern and efficient data structures and algorithms.
